Of all of the viruses for which we tested, human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus NL63 were most strongly linked to child care attendance, occurring in 82% and 78% of infected children, respectively. Picornaviruses were the most commonly identified virus group (269 [49.5%]). Influenza virus and adenovirus illnesses had the greatest impact, with fever in more than three quarters and requiring, on average, > 1 local doctor visit per illness.

There is impaired motility of gallbladder, with delayed emptying; this leads to the development of biliary sludge and gallstones. Thus, pregnant women have progressive increase in residual volume of gallbladder throughout the pregnancy, which returns to normal volume shortly after delivery. Contrary to the popular belief, there is high incidence of biliary colic in pregnant women, which gets better with conservative management. If intervention is required, however, it is best done in the second trimester and is generally well tolerated.\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 37-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 29 weeks' gestation comes to the physician because of colicky postprandial abdominal pain.
